      "content_text": "As you might already know, Bevy is a relatively new game engine written in Rust using a Data Driven approach. This blog post is an introduction to Bevy showing how to build a Cave Generator based on a cellular automaton. Even if you are not familiar with cellular automata, you probably already have heard about the Game of Life of John Conway.\nAll the code used in this tutorial is available on GitHub, feel free to clone and play with it.",
