This blog post is an introduction to Bevy showing how to build a Cave Generator based on a cellular automaton. Even if you are unfamiliar with cellular automata, you probably already have heard about the Game of Life of John Conway. In order to create a cave generator the principle is exactly the same, only the rules are modified to generate simple caves.","url":"/2022/02/20/cave-generator/","date_published":"2022-02-20 00:00:00 +0000 UTC","tags":["Bevy"]}]}
